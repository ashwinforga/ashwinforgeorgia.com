      <p className="margin-bottom-4">
        Voters, especially women, middle partisans on both sides, young, and voters from minority communities need to read in the mail that Shawn Still supports Georgia's abortion ban, opposes all common sense gun safety laws, and has been indicted on 7 felony counts as a leader in the Fake Elector scheme in Georgia to steal their votes.

      <h3 className="font-heading-lg text-primary-darker margin-top-4">Summary</h3>
      
      <p className="margin-bottom-3">
        Ashwin Ramaswami is a small business owner who was born and raised in Johns Creek and is ready to get to work for the people of Georgia. He wants to work across partisan lines to restore and protect women's reproductive freedom, pass common sense gun safety laws, and ensure our elections are free and fair.

        Shawn Still supports Georgia's abortion ban and has pledged that he would vote to make abortion completely illegal and put fertility treatments, like IVF, at risk. He was even endorsed by a group that wants to make abortion illegal, even in cases of rape or incest.
      </p>
      
      <p className="margin-bottom-3">
        Instead of getting guns off the streets and protecting Georgians who have been victims of gun violence, Shawn Still has promised to oppose any common sense, bipartisan gun safety laws and is making it even easier for criminals to get their hands on illegal guns.

        Shawn Still was indicted as part of the election interference chaos during the counting of votes in Fulton County after the 2020 election. He is facing 7 felony charges for forging illegal documents as a fake elector and trying to overturn elections in Georgia. He even sued Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn the election results. Because of his felony indictment, Governor Brian Kemp launched an investigation into Still.
